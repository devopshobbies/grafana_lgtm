## Deploying Grafana Mimir on Kubernetes Cluster Using Its Helm Chart
I created a custom Helm values file named `mimir-distributed-values.yml`, where I configured Mimir to use MinIO as the backend storage for storing metrics and metadata. Additionally, I set up an Alertmanager FallbackConfig, which serves as a default Alertmanager configuration for any tenant that does not have a custom configuration defined. This ensures that alerts are still routed and managed appropriately even when tenant-specific configurations are absent, providing a robust fallback mechanism within the multi-tenant Mimir setup
